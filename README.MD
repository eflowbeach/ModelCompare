# ModelCompare

This is a tool to compare NWS forecasts with model data. The data is generated using GFE in AWIPS. The plotting is modeled off of [Cubism's Horizon](https://github.com/square/cubism/wiki/Horizon) plots within a [Qooxdoo](http://qooxdoo.org/) inline application.

Cubism.js is a [D3](http://d3js.org) plugin for visualizing time series.

[Qooxdoo Repo](https://github.com/qooxdoo/qooxdoo) is needed for "compiling".
