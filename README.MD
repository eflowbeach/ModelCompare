# ModelCompare
---------------------------

This is a tool to compare NWS forecasts with model data. The data is generated using GFE in AWIPS. The plotting is modeled off of [Cubism's Horizon](https://github.com/square/cubism/wiki/Horizon) plots within a [Qooxdoo](http://qooxdoo.org/) inline application.

Cubism.js is a [D3](http://d3js.org) plugin for visualizing time series. Use Cubism to construct better realtime dashboards, pulling data from [Graphite](https://github.com/square/cubism/wiki/Graphite), [Cube](https://github.com/square/cubism/wiki/Cube) and other sources. Cubism is available under the [Apache License](LICENSE).
